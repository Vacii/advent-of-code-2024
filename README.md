# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place in December, offering a new two-part puzzle every day from December 1st to 25th. It's a great way to improve problem-solving skills and learn new programming techniques.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Folder Descriptions

- `dayXX/`: Contains the input file (`input.txt`) and solution script (`solution.py`) for each day.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts and helper functions used across multiple days.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project.
